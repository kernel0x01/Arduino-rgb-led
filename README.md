#RGB LED Blink with User Input
 
 This is an Arduino project that allows the user to input a color name and make an RGB LED blink in that color.

#Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

  An Arduino board (tested on Arduino Uno and Nano)
  
  An RGB LED
  
  3 x 220 ohm resistors
  
  Jumper wires
  
  A breadboard (optional)
  
  #Installation
  
  Connect the RGB LED to the Arduino board as follows:
  
  Red pin to pin 8
  
  Green pin to pin 9
  
  Blue pin to pin 10
 
  Each pin should also have a 220 ohm resistor in series with it.
 
  Connect the common cathode pin of the LED to GND.
  
  Upload the rgbled.ino sketch to the Arduino board.
